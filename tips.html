        <ul>
            <li>If a site looks sketchy, it usually is</li>
            <li>Don't install software from unofficial sources</li>
            <li>Don't click on ads, especially on sketchy sites</li>
            <li>Install a trusted Ad Blocker like <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/" target="_blank">uBlock Origin</a></li>
            <li>Hover over links to see their actual destination (most browsers show this in the bottom left)</li>
            <li>Download sites often have fake download button ads that lead to malware</li>
            <li>Sometimes scam sites pretend you are already infected and have you download "antivirus" which is actually the real virus</li>
